A cold gust of wind swept through the empty streets of the small town as Mary walked home from work. The streetlights flickered overhead, casting long shadows on the pavement. She was used to the quiet, but tonight it felt different. The usual hum of life seemed absent, like the world had paused. Her footsteps echoed in the silence, each one louder than the last. Her thoughts drifted to the meeting she had just left—the one where she had been handed a layoff notice after five years of hard work. It hadn’t been unexpected, but still, the sting of it felt raw. She shoved her hands deeper into her coat pockets and hurried her pace, eager to reach the comfort of her apartment.
