When she finally arrived home, she stood for a moment in the doorway, unsure whether to step inside or just turn around and leave. The apartment was dark, save for the faint glow of the streetlight filtering through the window. She had always loved this little spaceâ€”its worn wooden floors, the small kitchen with its chipped cabinets, and the plant on the windowsill that had somehow survived her neglect. But tonight, it felt like a cage. She flicked on the light, revealing the stack of unpaid bills that had been accumulating on the kitchen counter. With a sigh, she set down her bag and took a seat at the small dining table, staring at the pile before her. It was a reminder of everything she had yet to figure out.
